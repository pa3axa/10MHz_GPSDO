Errata for PA3AXA | GPSDO V1.1 Hardware
---------------------------------------

1 GPS Module Ground Pin 1, connection
  is missing. Connect the nearest ground.

2 Arduino D8 not connected to 1PPS
  needs a wire to a 5V PPS from true hole
  near 74HC4046.

3 10MHZ input 74HC390 add 10nF in series
  with input pin 1.

4 Cap Multiplier not working as expected.
  Feel free to fix design. For now
  
  Do not mount T1 C13 R10,
  Connect Collector to Emittor PAD
  Change 6V LDO to 5V LDO.


5 Change R2 and C2 position mislabeld
  on board. C2 needs to be close to
  ADC pin.

6 Cut Serial Connection to Arduino PIN16 
  Needs to be connected to Software Serial PIN xx


7 C24, C27, C28, C29, C30 56pf not mounted
  Copy from refrecence design to cut noise.

8 L1 is a bit to large but will fit.

9 R6, R7 I2C Pull-UP not mounted



Errata GPSDO V1.1 Software
---------------------------------------

1 Current version is the orginal made Lars
  just change A0 to A7 in the sketch. (3x).

2 Set gain parameter to 200 as a starting point
  for Bliley OCXO NV47A12B2.

3 I2C display not implemented for now, same for
  rotery connector if it ever will happen.

4 Using USB its possible to command the GPS reciever
  and the Arduino. They booth and share the RX port for
  commands. all GPS commands start with $

5 GPS Has lots of options but needs more time to investigate
  standard settings work, currently always PPS 1s even when
  GPS is not locked.

6 Arduino Onboard LED on PIN 13 shows locked status Software.
  But if no GPS is recieved its just locked to free
  running PPS from GPS module.
